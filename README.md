PyObjC Examples
===============

Purpose
-------

This is a simple example app to demonstrate how to create a Mac-native app using PyObjC to bridge between Python and a Mac-native NIB interface.

I cobbled this together from numerous searching across the net. It works on Lion 10.7.2, Xcode 4.2 and the versions of Python (2.7) PyObjC that comes as standard on the Mac.

I did this purely to teach myself how to do it, so if anyone has comments or corrections, please tell me.
